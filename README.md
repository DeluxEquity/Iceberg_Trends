Apache Iceberg Trends Market Place - Team 2
“This project repository is created in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Big Data Analytics course offered by the Master of Science in Business Analytics program at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota.” 

Apache Iceberg is a high-performance, open-source table format designed to bring data warehouse reliability to data lakes. It offers robust features like ACID transactions, schema evolution, native support for inserts/updates/deletes, and built-in time travel via a snapshot-based model. Unlike traditional data lakes, Iceberg enables efficient data modification and querying by maintaining detailed file-level metadata, supporting hidden partitioning, and integrating natively with multiple engines like Spark, Flink, Trino, and Hive. Its engine-agnostic and open governance design sets it apart from competitors like Delta Lake and Hudi, making it ideal for large-scale, distributed data environments that require flexibility, performance, and long-term adaptability.
